# BiSpectral-SE

This repository provides the **bispectral versions** of popular speech enhancement baseline models.  
The original baseline implementations are taken from their official open-source repositories:

- **[CMGAN](https://github.com/ruizhecao96/CMGAN)**
- **[MPSENet](https://github.com/yxlu-0102/MP-SENet)**

Please refer to the respective baseline models for their bispectral adaptations in this project.
